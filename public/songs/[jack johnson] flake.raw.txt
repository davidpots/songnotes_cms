I know she says it's alright
You can make it up next time
I know she thinks it's not right
There ain't no use in lying

Maybe she thinks I know something, maybe
Maybe she thinks its fine
Maybe she knows something I don't, I'm so
I'm so tired, so tired of trying

It seems to me that maybe
Pretty much always means no
So don't tell me
You might just let it go 

And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
'Cause no one, no, nah
No one likes to be let down

I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes, and
I know that when she says she's gonna try
Well it might not work because of other ties

I know she usually has some other ties, and I
Wouldn't wanna break'em, nah... I wouldn't wanna break'em
Maybe she'll help me to untie this, but
Until then, well, I'm gonna have to lie too

It seems to me that maybe
Pretty much always means no
So don't tell me
You might just let it go 

And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
'Cause no one, no nah
No one likes to be let down

It seems to me that maybe
Pretty much always means no
So don't tell me
You might just let it go 

The harder that you try baby, the further you'll fall
Even with all the money in the whole wide world
Please please please don't pass me
Please please please don't pass me
Please please please don't pass me by

Everything you know about me now baby you gonna have to change
Gonna have to call me by a brand new name
Please please please don't drag me
Please please please don't drag me
Please please please don't drag me down

Just like a tree down by the water baby I shall not move
Even after all your silly things you do-------
Please please please don't drag me
Please please please don't drag me
Please please please don't drag me down
