Jesus Christ, girl
What are people gonna think
When I show up to one of several funerals
I've attended for grandpa this week... with you... with me...

Someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig

Jesus Christ, girl
It hasn't been long, so it seems
Since I was picking out an island and a tomb for you
At the Hollywood Cemetery... you kiss... on me

We should let this dead guy sleep
We should let this dead guy sleep

Jesus Christ, girl
I laid up for hours in a daze
Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins... you came... I think

'Cause the marble made my cheeks look pink
But I'm unsure of so many things

Ooohh....

Someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig
