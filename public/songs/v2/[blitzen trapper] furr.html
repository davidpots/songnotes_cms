</span>Yeah, when I was only seventeen
I could hear the angels whispering

<span class="chords_inline">         <strong class="chord">F</strong>              <strong class="chord">C</strong>
</span>    So I drove into the woods

</span>    Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog

It turned out to be the howling of a dog

    Or a wolf to be exact
    The sound sent shivers down my back
    But I was drawn into the pack and before long

They allowed me to join in and sing their song

    So from the cliffs and highest hill
    Yeah, we would gladly get our fill
    Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn

And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong

    For my flesh had turned to fur
    Yeah, and my thoughts, they surely were
    Turned to instinct and obedience to God

</span>        You can wear your fur, like a river on fire
        But you better be sure, if you're making God a liar
        I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on the fire

</span>            Don't be afraid of what you've learned

On the day that I turned twenty-three
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree

    When suddenly a girl
    With skin the color of a pearl
    She wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see

She was listening for the angels just like me

    So I stood and looked about
    I brushed the leaves off of my snout
    And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
	
You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees

    So I took her by the arm
    We settled down upon a farm
    And raised our children up as gently as you please

[instrumental break]
	
    And now my fur has turned to skin
    And I've been quickly ushered in
    To a world that I confess I do not know

But I still dream of running careless through the snow

    And through the howling winds that blow,
    Across the ancient distant flow
    It fill our bodies up like water 'till we know

        You can wear your fur, like a river on fire
        But you better be sure, if you're making God a liar
        I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on the fire
            So if you're gonna get made
            Don't be afraid of what you've learned</pre>
