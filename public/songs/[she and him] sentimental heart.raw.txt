Cried all night 'til there was nothing more 
What use am I as a heap on the floor
Heaving devotion but it’s just no good 
Taking it hard just like you knew I would 

Old habits die hard 
When you’ve got... when you’ve got a sentimental heart 
Piece of the puzzle, you’re my missing part 
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart 
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart

Cried all night 'til there was nothing more 
What use am I as a heap on the floor 
Heaving devotion but it’s just no good 
Taking it hard just like you knew I would 

Old habits die hard 
When you’ve got... when you’ve got a sentimental heart 
Piece of the puzzle, you’re my missing part 
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart 
Oh, what can you do with a sentimental heart

Ahhhhh...
